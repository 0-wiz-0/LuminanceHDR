<h1>FAQ for Qtpfsgui</h1>


<dl>
<A name="name"><dt><strong>Q: What is the meaning of the name qtpfsgui?</strong></dt></A>
<dd>A: The name can be decomposed in 3 parts: Qt-pfs-gui.
	<ol>
	<li><strong>Qt</strong>: the program uses Qt4 (www.trolltech.com) to show its graphical widgets.</li>
	<li><strong>pfs</strong>: the main backend library and original sourcecode base.</li>
	<li><strong>gui</strong>: this stands simply for graphical user interface.</li>
	</ol>
</dd>
<A name="tmop"><dt><strong>Q: What is the meaning of the various settings for tonemapping operator X?</strong></dt></A>
<dd>A: To answer precisely this question one would have to explain the inner workings of TMO X, in terms of the original research paper.<br>
At the end of the day all that matters (to some people, at least) is to fiddle with the settings until you obtain a nice result.

<A name="exiftiff"><dt><strong>Q: Why can't qtpfsgui transfer the exif tags to TIFF files?</strong></dt></A>
<dd>A: Because the library qtpfsgui uses to perform this task (exiv2) doesn't support writing to tiff files yet. It's in the working, though.</dd>
</dl>
<br>
<A name="immediatechange"><dt><strong>Q: Can we have the tonemapping dialog apply its settings as soon as the user changes a value? In other words, can we avoid having an "apply" button?</strong></dt></A>
<dd>A: Future plans include having a setting that enables the user to switch between the 2 modes.</dd>
