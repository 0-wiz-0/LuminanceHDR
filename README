1. What it is
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Luminance HDR is a graphical user interface (based on the Qt5 toolkit) that provides a
workflow for HDR imaging.

Supported HDR formats:
* OpenEXR (extension: exr)
* Radiance RGBE (extension: hdr)
* Tiff formats: 16bit, 32bit (float) and LogLuv (extension: tiff)
* Raw image formats (extension: various)
* PFS native format (extension: pfs)

Supported LDR formats:
* JPEG, PNG, PPM, PBM, TIFF, FITS

Supported features:
* Create an HDR file from a set of images (JPEG, TIFF 8bit and 16bit, RAW)
of the same scene taken at different exposure setting
* Save and load HDR files
* Rotate and resize HDR files
* Tonemap HDR images
* Projective Transformations
* Copy EXIF data between sets of images
* Supports internationalization

Raw image formats are supported - and treated as HDRs - thanks to LibRAW
(http://www.libraw.org/).

Make sure you read the "Dependencies" Section in the INSTALL file. If you intend to make a
package for a GNU/Linux distribution, please refer to the same file for more information.

The code is in part based on the existing open source packages:
- "pfstools", "pfstmo" and "pfscalibration" by Grzegorz Krawczyk and Rafal Mantiuk
- "qpfstmo", by Nicholas Phillips.
Without their contribution all of this would have not been possible.
