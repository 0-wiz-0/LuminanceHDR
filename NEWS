13/02/2006 v1.8.0 of qtpfsgui
Initial RAW image format support and options panel. Also, added linux desktop integration.

29/01/2006 v1.7 of qtpfsgui
better EXIF tag check: if exif data not found user is warned and operation is aborted, this should eliminate the "red screen" bug completely. Let me know if it doesn't :).
restored PFS stream fileformat compatibility.

18/01/2006 v1.6 of qtpfsgui
drastic changes in code layout/design aimed to reduce memory usage.
``Fit to window'' option now keeps image ratio.

25/12/2006 v1.5 of qtpfsgui
New feature (BETA): anti-ghosting.
Restored the "what you see is what you save" behaviour in TMO dialog (fixed saveLDR bug).
Removed buttons in the TMO section: modifying the settings implies istantaneous computation.
Zoom in/out/original and fit to window enabled.
Fixed save ldr dialog (if no extension specified it uses the one belonging to the current ``filter'').
The application now remembers the last used directory for
	open/save hdr
	load/save settings
	load input exposures

22/12/2006 v1.4 of qtpfsgui
new feature: tonemapping settings, you can save the current tonemapping settings and the pre/post gamma values to a text file which you can later re-load.
Changed behaviour in the TMO dialog:
	Combobox moved to the top of the preview image.
	Clicking save you'll get the full (100%) input hdr tonemapped with current settings.
fixed several memory leaks and inefficiencies.

15/12/2006 v1.2 of qtpfsgui.
moved development to Qt4.
Windows version can be compiled with mingw.
Huge integration of code: pfstools/pfstmo/pfshdrcreate, now it's standalone.

15/12/2006 v1.0 of qtpfsgui.
2 things:
1) pfshdrcreate is not needed anymore as an external executable, i.e. as an externa backend, 
because the code of pfshdrcreate has been integrated into qtpfsgui.
2) This is problably the last version of qtpfsgui using Qt3.
I'm moving development to Qt4, so that a windows version can get developed as well.

12/03/2006 changed name of dependency package pfscalibration2 to pfshdrcreate, updated README and .pro file.

12/01/2006 Released first public version.
