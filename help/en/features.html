<h2>Features overview</h2>

<h3>Streamlined localized user interface</h3>

<p>Creating HDR files is very easy: you just drop your bracketed shots from file or photos manager to the main window and in few more clicks you have an HDR file which you can then tonemap.</p>

<p>Qtpfsgui is available in the following languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>Czech (outdated)</li>
<li>English</li>
<li>French (outdated)</li>
<li>German</li>
<li>Hungarian (outdated)</li>
<li>Indonesian (outdated)</li>
<li>Italian</li>
<li>Polish (outdated)</li>
<li>Russian</li>
<li>Spanish (outdated)</li>
<li>Turkish (outdated)</li>
</ul>

<p>If your language is not supported or localization is incomplete or outdated 
and you are willing to take care of that, please learn 
<a href="contributing_translating.html">how to do it</a>.</p>

<h3>Supported HDR file formats</h3>

<p>Qtpfsgui reads and writes:</p>

<ul>
<li>OpenEXR (.exr)</li>
<li>Radiance RGBE (.hdr)</li>
<li>Logluv TIFF (.tif)</li>
<li>PFS stream (.pfs)</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally Raw images can be opened using DCRaw.</p>

<h3>Supported LDR file formats</h3>

<p>Qtpfsgui supports the following low dynamic range file formats:</p>

<ul>
<li>JPEG</li>
<li>TIFF (only 8bpc)</li>
<li>PNG (only saving)</li>
<li>PBM (only saving)</li>
</ul>

<p>Qtpfsgui can also write Exif metadata to JPEG, PNG and TIFF files using Exiv2.</p>

<h3>Extensive help system</h3>

<p>We don't really pretend that HDR imaging is easy. It surely can be easy if 
lousy results is what you want. For the rest of you we bundle a solid help 
system to help you getting the most of your pictures.</p>

<p>The help system is, again, localizable. Right now only English version is 
available, but you can <a href="contributing_translating.html">contribute 
a translation</a> into your native language, if you really want to.</p>

<h3>Free to distribute</h3>

<p>Qtpfsgui is a free-as-in-speech application licensed under terms of GNU GPL. Which in fact means:</p>

<ul>
<li>You don't have to pay developers of Qtpfsgui for a license</li>
<li>You may install Qtpfsgui on as many computers as you can reach</li>
<li>You may for god's sake modify Q's source code, but you will have to share it with us, if you distribute the modified version</li>
</ul>
