05-02-2007 Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>

* code that displays negative hdr pixels in black has been commented out.
* libpfs: added renameRGBChannelsToXYZ() renameXYZChannelsToRGB() convertRGBChannelsToXYZ() convertXYZChannelsToRGB()

25-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
Christmas changes:
*  Initial anti-ghosting (BETA) feature.
*  restored the "what you see is what you save" behaviour in TMO dialog. (fix saveLDR bug)
*  removed buttons in the TMO section: modifying the settings implies istantaneous computation.
*  fixed shortcuts action functionality.
*  fixed save ldr dialog (if no extension specified it uses the one belonging to the current ``filter'')
*  zoom in/out/original and fit to window enabled
*  the application now remembers the last used directory for
	open/save hdr
	load/save settings
	load input exposures

22-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
v1.4
*  tonemapping dialog: added save... load... line_edit pushbutton widgets.
*  loading input ldr exposures      starts from last used directory.
*  loading input TMO settings file  starts from last used directory.
*  fixed stupid inefficiency while showing hdr.
*  fixed memory leaks while closing hdr window.
*  implemented loadsettings, savesettings, fromGui2Txt, fromTxt2Gui

20-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
*  Changed behaviour in the TMO dialog: 
	Combobox moved to the top of the preview image.
	Clicking save you'll get the full (100%) input hdr tonemapped with current settings.
*  Cleared some pfs buffers when the TMO dialog gets closed.
*  Added a "Done!" label that shows up when the input ldr exposures have finished loading.

20-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
*  changed some #includes
*  added comment showing original pfshdrcreate hack: it was NOT in svn, now it's there only for future reference, in case it's needed.
*  restructuring of svn repository in branches/qt4: moved hdrcreate* files into their own directory

18-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
v1.3
*  fixed bug: some cameras (NIKON D50) don't write ISO values in the JPEGS. That led to a wrong (completely red) hdr result. Now if qtpfsgui doesn't find a ISO value, it uses internally a default value of ISO=100 for all input exposures.

15-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
*  created branch of qtpfsgui, using Qt4. (in svn the code is in branches/qtpfsgui-qt4)
*  the code integrates libpfs/pfstmo/pfshdrcreate, now it's stand-alone.
*  the code requires libexiv2-devel
*  Compilable both in linux and in windows with mingw.
*  supported hdr formats in windows are only: HDR(rgbe) and PFS.
   Linux also supports OpenEXR. Still problems compiling OpenEXR in windows with MinGW, seems like no one has ever done it... :(
   Also, OpenEXR is compilable with Cygwin, but Qt (qmake and everything) doesn't work with cygwin.
