04-03-2004 v1.8.1 Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
* new dialogs: resize and transplant
* new actions in mainwindow: transplant and resize
* now using doublespinboxes rather than QLineEdits in tonemapping dialog
* now using "apply" button
* initial dependency detection system when compiling in linux
* critical changes in gang.{h,cpp}, to use QDoubleSpinboxes
* updated icip06 exponent: 24->12 (it still seems to not work) :(
* hdrwizard: improved error message
* hdrwizard & mainwindow: gathered all raw formats in 1 filter
* swapped increase/decrease exposure
* writing tonemapping parameters in output ldr

13-02-2007 Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
* added initial raw image format input support in "Open Hdr..." 
	and in the "New Hdr..." wizard.
	the raw import functionality is obtained via dcraw's code.
* added settings panel.
* added KDE/GNOME desktop integration

05-02-2007 Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
* Fixed exif calculations when APEX values are used. This fixes another red-image hdr bug.
* Fixed a Segmentation Fault (const/noconst uchar*) bug that happens when compiling in Linux (Suse 10.2) against recent versions of Qt4.
* Fixed some small memory leaks.

29-01-2006 Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
* The only LDR image format supported is now JPEG, the one that has EXIF tags.
* better EXIF tag check: if exif data not found user is warned and operation is aborted
* code that displays negative hdr pixels in black has been commented out.
* libpfs: added renameRGBChannelsToXYZ() renameXYZChannelsToRGB() convertRGBChannelsToXYZ() convertXYZChannelsToRGB()
* restored PFS stream compatibility (PFS stream has XYZ color chans, not RGB!).
* fixed color bug for reinhard04 tmo.

18-01-2006 Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
* drastic changes in code layout/design aimed to reduce memory usage.
* ``Fit to window'' option now keeps image ratio.
* Faster computation of Durand va fftw3. Users need to download the new Win
Dep Pckg.
		

25-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
Christmas changes:
*  Initial anti-ghosting (BETA) feature.
*  restored the "what you see is what you save" behaviour in TMO dialog. (fix saveLDR bug)
*  removed buttons in the TMO section: modifying the settings implies istantaneous computation.
*  fixed shortcuts action functionality.
*  fixed save ldr dialog (if no extension specified it uses the one belonging to the current ``filter'')
*  zoom in/out/original and fit to window enabled
*  the application now remembers the last used directory for
	open/save hdr
	load/save settings
	load input exposures

v1.4
*  tonemapping dialog: added save... load... line_edit pushbutton widgets.
*  loading input ldr exposures      starts from last used directory.
*  loading input TMO settings file  starts from last used directory.
*  fixed stupid inefficiency while showing hdr.
*  fixed memory leaks while closing hdr window.
*  implemented loadsettings, savesettings, fromGui2Txt, fromTxt2Gui

20-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
*  Changed behaviour in the TMO dialog: 
	Combobox moved to the top of the preview image.
	Clicking save you'll get the full (100%) input hdr tonemapped with current settings.
*  Cleared some pfs buffers when the TMO dialog gets closed.
*  Added a "Done!" label that shows up when the input ldr exposures have finished loading.

20-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
*  changed some #includes
*  added comment showing original pfshdrcreate hack: it was NOT in svn, now it's there only for future reference, in case it's needed.
*  restructuring of svn repository in branches/qt4: moved hdrcreate* files into their own directory

18-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
v1.3
*  fixed bug: some cameras (NIKON D50) don't write ISO values in the JPEGS. That led to a wrong (completely red) hdr result. Now if qtpfsgui doesn't find a ISO value, it uses internally a default value of ISO=100 for all input exposures.

15-12-2006  Giuseppe Rota <grota@users.sourceforge.net>
*  created branch of qtpfsgui, using Qt4. (in svn the code is in branches/qtpfsgui-qt4)
*  the code integrates libpfs/pfstmo/pfshdrcreate, now it's stand-alone.
*  the code requires libexiv2-devel
*  Compilable both in linux and in windows with mingw.
*  supported hdr formats in windows are only: HDR(rgbe) and PFS.
   Linux also supports OpenEXR. Still problems compiling OpenEXR in windows with MinGW, seems like no one has ever done it... :(
   Also, OpenEXR is compilable with Cygwin, but Qt (qmake and everything) doesn't work with cygwin.
